On 2/14 a pipe froze and 2nd floor heat stopped working sometime in the early hours of the morning.  Presumably this effected the heat transfer of our living room.
On 2/14 at around 4:30PM a pipe above our living room burst and the second mabul occured. The apartment doors were open for a while as we moved furniture to the hallway.
On 2/15 around 10AM we covered the computers with plastic to protect them while the plumber worked.  This may have effected heat transfer.
